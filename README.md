Got Git
=======

Inspired by [ProGit website](http://progit.org/), I use the same technique (Jekyll) to maintain my books and blog.

* Maintenance for my book on Git in Chinese, named GotGit.
* Resources on my public ebook on GitHub, named GotGitHub.
* Other articles on previous worldhello.net, which were written before [my company](http://www.ossxp.com) set up.
